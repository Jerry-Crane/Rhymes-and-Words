   <div class="text"> 
      <t> After 20 more years of exhausting life, when we are all tired
     <br> Of excess fame or of not being admired
      <br>Take a walk down the memory lane
      <br>To these childhood days and it’s fun insane
      <br><br>
    
      When you find no reason to take a walk
      <br>Or with loved ones you find no reason to talk
      <br>Think about when with family and friends we used to hang out
      <br>And never shut our babbling mouth
     
      <br><br>
      
       When frustrated about profits of life
      <br>And forget to smile in it’s stride
      <br>Take a walk down the memory lane
      <br>To when there was no stress, no worry, no loss, no gain
     
      <br><br>
      
      When being drained into a path of wrong
      <br>Which will be regretted lifelong
      <br>Do remember this childhood time
      <br>When lying to parents was also a crime
      
      <br><br>
      
     When stressed with life and it’s worry
     <br> When life’s  in a rush and in a hurry
      <br>Don’t forget to get wet in the rain
      <br>While taking a walk down the memory lane
      
      <br><br>
