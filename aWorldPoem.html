   <h1>A World Without Me and You</h1>
   </div>
   
   <div class="text"> <pL>Let's paint a picture of a world so new,
      <br>
      A world without me and you.
      <br>
      This picture so colourful so bright,
      <br>
      Is filled with joy and heavenly light.
      <br><br>
    
    The birds fly with such freedom and cheer,
      <br>
      With no one to capture them or pollute the sky so clear.
      <br>
      The trees are so green and the flowers are
      such a beauty,
      <br>
      With no one to cut or pluck them in the
      name of duty.
      <br>
      The world in the painting is such a paradise
      <br>
      With no one to make it dirty and bring it's
      demise.
      <br><br>
      Mother Earth has welcomed us into it's
      colours so bright,
      <br>But we think to paint it grey with smoke
      and dust, is our right.
      <br>The Earth's frustration has shown we are
      merely it's guests,
      <br>To keep or throw us
      the power rests.
      <br><br>
      The Earth can thrive much better without
      us,
      <br>But we cannot, so let's bring to life whatâ€™s
      on the canvas
      <br>Let's feel our love for the Earth where we
      grew,
      <br>And even with us make it as pure as the
      world without ME and YOU.
