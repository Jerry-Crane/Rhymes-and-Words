  <div class="text"> <p> Rhymes and words is  a project of two curious 9th graders. It is a hub for creative writing.
<br><br>
     Creative writing, as defined by wikipedia is any writing that goes beyond the bounds of normal, professional, journalistic, academic and technical form of literature.
<br><br>
     We, at Rhymes and Words believe that writing is one of the best ways of storytelling. It is a vast and diverse form to express oneself in the most subtle yet impactful manner.
<br><br>      
     This is a hobby website which allows me, who writes essays and my best friend, who writes poems, show our works to all. It can be for a good read or an inspiration.
<br><br>
      People can also email us to suggest new topics or contribute with their own works. It is a happy place of exchange to promote creative writing.
