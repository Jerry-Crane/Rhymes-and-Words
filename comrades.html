      <t>And the day’s here,
<br>At the end of the year
<br>Where we swerve,
<br>And the fresh things being carve
<br>And the bygones resides only in our hearts.
      <br><br>
    
     The only fear is that,
<br>Whether we’ll the same as the past.
<br>The memories we fabricated,
<br>The best times we depleted,
<br>The promises we weaved
<br>And the things we portioned,
<br>We’ll be the same or it’ll metamorphose.

<br>Or will stay as it is, forever and ever….
     
      <br><br>
      
      But as you all oathed me,
<br>Growing up, but not apart
<br>This crew will always be the heart.
<br>It prospect me of our togetherness
<br>And our altruistic oneness.
