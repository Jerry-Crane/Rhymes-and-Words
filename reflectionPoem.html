      What does a reflection show
     <br> Our inner depth or just the outer glow
     <br> It depends on which reflection we wish to see
     <br> In the eyes our loved ones or in the waters of the sea
    
    <br><BR>
    
    <A reflection in our life represents a goal
      <br>To enhance our physical appearance and beautify our soul
      <br>It is on us to make the choice 
      <br>to worry about wrinkles and scars
     <br> Or listen to our inner voice
     
    <br> <BR>
    
    A reflection can make us improve for with whom we have a love tide
     <br> Or supress our identity and push into the thought “Who am I”
     <br> It depends on which reflection we wish to see
     <br> One in the criticism of loved ones or the one in the advice of strangers which is needlessly free
    <BR><br>
    
     A reflection can lead us to the path of right
      <br>Or can put us on a path without a speck of light
      <br>It depends on which reflection we wish to see
      <br>In the mirror of the path of darkness
      <br>Or the conscience which resides in me
      <br> <BR>
