   <div class="text"> 
      <t> There's a knock on the door
<br>Has monster come back
<br>Your cresent eyes dark
<br>Prove your nights apart
<br>Make it silent, let nobody know
<br>What do you think they would do
<br>When they see the tears flow
<br>Would they come to you
<br>Or would you grow more afar


      <br><br>
    
     The chatter in your skull, winning a bit everytime
<br>You stow away the words, but they come back harsh in a tide
<br>The mirror reflecting you back, as the person you want to hide


     
      <br><br>
      
       Here a storm, there a draught
<br>Your screams drowned down, your breath cut-off
<br>Eyes filling like the deep deep seas, but drying away like water springs
<br>You find your ways through the rounding maze
<br>And come out in a soulless daze


      <br><br>
      
      Your heart in a desperate pound, watching as your world burns down
<br>Thoughts like a merry go round, always making so loud a sound
<br>Fury, a feeling so warm and strange
<br>It does all harm and leaves just pain


       <br><br>
       Once you lose it, it never comes back
<br>So find something that stays intact
<br>Like warmth, and joy, in a world you never tried
<br>A world full of broken hearts, just like you
<br>A world of hearts still beating through

        <br><br>
   You hope that the sun rises, never goes down, even if just for a day
<br>That would be just enough to run through and find your way
<br>Move the curtains aside, let the rays hit you
<br>And this is all for you because you can shine so bright
